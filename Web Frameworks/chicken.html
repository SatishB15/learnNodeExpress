        <li>Main ingredients</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>2 carrots, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 free range chicken, about 1.5kg/3lb 5oz</li>
            <li>1 lemon, halved</li>
            <li>small bunch thyme (optional)</li>
            <li>25g butter, softened</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For the gravy</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp plain flour</li>
            <li>250ml chicken stock (a cube is fine)</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <h3>STEP 1</h3>
    Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Have a shelf ready in the middle of the oven without any shelves above it.
    <h3>STEP 2</h3>
    Scatter 1 roughly chopped onion and 2 roughly chopped carrots over the base of a roasting tin that fits the whole 1
    ½ kg chicken, but doesn’t swamp it.

    <h3>STEP 3</h3>
    Season the cavity of the chicken liberally with salt and pepper, then stuff with 2 lemon halves and a small bunch of
    thyme, if using.
    <h3>STEP 4</h3>
    Sit the chicken on the vegetables, smother the breast and legs all over with 25g softened butter, then season the
    outside with salt and pepper.
    <h3>STEP 5</h3>
    Place in the oven and leave, undisturbed, for 1 hr 20 mins – this will give you a perfectly roasted chicken. To
    check, pierce the thigh with a skewer and the juices should run clear.
    <h3>STEP 6</h3>
    Carefully remove the tin from the oven and, using a pair of tongs, lift the chicken to a dish or board to rest for
    15-20 mins. As you lift the dish, let any juices from the chicken pour out of the cavity into the roasting tin.
    <h3>STEP 7</h3>
    While the chicken is resting, make the gravy. Place the roasting tin over a low flame, then stir in 1 tbsp flour and
    sizzle until you have a light brown, sandy paste.
    <h3>STEP 8</h3>
    Gradually pour in 250ml chicken stock, stirring all the time, until you have a thickened sauce.
    <h3>STEP 9</h3>
    Simmer for 2 mins, using a wooden spoon to stir, scraping any sticky bits from the tin.
    <h3>STEP 10</h3>
    Strain the gravy into a small saucepan, then simmer and season to taste. When you carve the bird, add any extra
    juices to the gravy.
