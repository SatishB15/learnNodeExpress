            <li>100ml passata</li>
            <li>handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For the topping</li>
        <ul>
            <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced</li>
            <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
            <li>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved To finish</li>
            <li>handful of basil leaves (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <h3>STEP 1</h3>
    Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm
    water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a
    lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the
    dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.

    <h3>STEP 2</h3>
    Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room
    temperature while you get on with shaping the base.

    <h3>STEP 3</h3>
    Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured
    surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very
    thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.

    <h3>STEP 4</h3>
    Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven
    on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with
    olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10
    mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
